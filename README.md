# piemenu-qt
A simple pie menu QWidget implementation

 The pie menu is fully customizable for arbitrary amounts of buttons,
 disabled buttons, button icons and appearance parameters.
 All button clicks are published as a Qt signal containing the
 clicked button's index.
 
 When the pin/unpin button is activated, the pie menu can be pinned
 to keep it open until it is manually or programmatically closed.
